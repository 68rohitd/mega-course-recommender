# The mega course recommender
This has been an idea (since a long time) to create a curated list of courses (for various topics) so that beginners can get benefitted from that list! And I feel this is a very great time to start the project as there are many students looking for a project to contribute to in this **Hacktoberfest**

## How can you contribute?
Well, you just have to create a <your_username>.md file and add at least 4 courses (paid/free) to it. Your file should be in the following format:

```
topic_one : course_title : course_link
topic_two : course_title : course_link
topic_three : course_title : course_link
topic_four : course_title : course_link
```

actual example
```
python : the complete python course : https://udemy.com/complete-python
```

Please follow the same format else I would have to mark your pull request as invalid (I don't want to)!


If we get enough data this by mid of hacktober we might start the actual project this hacktober only!
All the best!
